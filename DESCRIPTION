Description: This package makes use of block-wise matrix structures linked to row-wise tensor products, which are build in conjuction with a factor variable. This includes implementations for arithmetic and algebraic operations on block diagonal matrices in order to avoid explicit calculations of row-wise tensor products and kronecker sums.
