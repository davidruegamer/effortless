**eff**icient **o**perations on **r**ow-wise **t**ensor product **l**inked **e**valuations with **s**pecial **s**tructures

This R package makes use of block-wise matrix structures linked to row-wise tensor products, which are build in conjuction with a factor variable. This includes implementations for arithmetic and algebraic operations on block diagonal matrices in order to avoid explicit calculations of row-wise tensor products and kronecker sums.
